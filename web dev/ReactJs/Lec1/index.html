    react = it is a javascript library which has some predefined functionalities to design a UI. Deals with components (kind of fn). its arch is comp based.
    why? in js to add functionality we have to go strep by step and have to code each like from fetching component to appending (imperitive approach) while in react just end state is enough so its easy (declerative approach)
    *also reusableity, duplication of code decr, readibility, sepration of concern pwd
    , maintaiblity

    SPA=single page application
        in this type we load a single html document and everything is dynamically changed, in it so after each action we dont actually change pages we dynamically display and hide some components like govt and netflix website
 
    Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser.
    JavaScript runtime environment LIKE JRE IN JAVA used to execute code


    package.json -> dependencies/ version /scripts of package 
    src -> app.js
            index.css  (contain css configuration for index.js)
            index.js (first file to be execute => fetches #root div from index.html => make that element a root of the react => now to show on ui i want to show something on ui for this react have a function"render" so we render an app component now whatever i wamt to print i add in that app component in app.js now this app component will be replaced by thst actual  div in index .html )

    public-> index.html -> has root id element

        if you see actually react code is getting converted to actual js , its not a actual js its jsx js extention (its html inside js)
        user friendly code we are writing that code is converted by npm start to valid html js css and render browser friendly code
    in react we use classList instead of class bcz in js class is a reserved keyword
