SERVER(backend) & frontend 
#there's one layer between this two to communicate which also provides security like google
#they both communicate/handshak through API's(application programming interface) say you want to give any task to server like  your 
schedule which is saved there on server then here frontends task is only to display this ie there is list created on front end and data 
to dispaly is dynamic you fetch it from server ie backend gives this dynamic info to show in front end this is done through API's it only
function like c++ you call them in frontend through http protocol (theres something like kurved operation)..

server-> its a computer only which is connected to many clientd in network.... part of working model of internet ....remote computer which 
is working for us
