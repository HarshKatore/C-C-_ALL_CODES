<!--	tag sequence matters ie if in above eg h1 come next to p then sequence is changed  
        br tag does not require closing tag so  its example of "empty tag,self closing tag" eg. img ,input also empty tag img is not if used as <img> </img> but we use it as <img/> see int these tags opening itseelf contains closing of tag
