/*
Forms of Inheritance in C++
inheritance is making second class which has all #public content of first+more content to avoid repetition
base class=first
derived=second
1.Single Inheritance=one base to one derived
2.Multiple Inheritance=multiple base to single derived
3.Hierarchical Inheritance=one base to multiple derived
4.Multilevel Inheritance=one base to next derived then next derived ie more than two level
5.Hybrid Inheritance=one base to two derived to one next derived ie competition of multiple inheritance here 
 multilevel,multiple,hierarchi
